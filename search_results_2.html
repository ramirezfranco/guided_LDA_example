Since then we ve been committed to fulfilling our mission of bringing students high-quality, inclusive events open to everyone irrespective of their experience. Our Mission Bring people together to create, learn, and have fun! The Team Our team comprises of innovative self starters who constantly want to empower the community. From computer scientists to entrepeneurs, our team has people of all backgrounds and experiences. An important element of HackCU is that all of our events are led exclusively by students. We teach and learn from our team members how to run and manage some of the largest technology events in the country. With this experience, our team members and alumni go on to work for some of the biggest names in tech and some even start their own companies.</td>

For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?). Completion: Does the hack work?

Besides gaining a basic understanding of using tools to monitor, generate, and reverse engineer network activity at home and in a vehicle, participants will also leave with SWAG. The first 40 people to join the workshop will receive a Neutral Vehicle t-shirt (size and availability depending), and we have 5 books authored by the same person who programmed the car simulation software and tools to be raffled off during the workshop. What do you need to download to prepare? We will provide a pre-loaded virtual machine to download that comes with all of the tools needed.</td>

A hackathon is a creative event for tech enthusiasts to gather and share their ideas. Hackathon participants typically form groups to work from scratch on a software or hardware project hack in a given limited time. What do they build? Imagination is their only limit! What will I need? Make sure to bring a valid ID! The rest will depend on what you will need to work on your project. Here is a list of what we recommend bringing for the event: your laptop, phone and their respective chargers, toiletries, a change of clothes, and a blanket. Where is ConUHacks happening? ConUHacks takes place in the heart of downtown Montreal, QC, Canada as part of Concordia University s Sir George Williams Campus. Can I participate?</td>

K H is intended to introduce HackCU participants and visitors to the world of amateur radio. What is Amateur Radio? Amateur radio (also known as ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings people, electronics and communication together. People use amateur radio to talk across town, around the world, or even into space. It s fun, social, educational, and can be a lifeline during times of need. Although amateur radio operators get involved for many reasons, they all have in common a basic knowledge of radio technology and operating principles, and pass an examination for a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission. This license enables them to use radio frequencies to reach out to the world and beyond. You do not need to learn Morse code to earn an amateur radio license.</td>

There are over 600,000 radio amateurs in the United States and over 2,000,000 worldwide. What s Happening Today At K H? We re demonstrating software defined radio (SDR), a combination of radio, computer, and Internet technology. We also have a low power FM voice station designed for local communication, commonly used when working with public service agencies. These are two small examples of what can be done with amateur radio. What Does K H Mean Anyway? All amateur radio operators are issued a unique callsign which identifies their station. K H is a special event callsign authorized specifically for HackCU V. The H stands for hack . How Do I Learn More? The American Radio Relay League is the national association of radio amateurs in the United States and a good source of information.</td>
