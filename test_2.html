                            <td>Leaving the venue for some time to hack elsewhere is fine. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others. All work on a project should be done at the hackathon. Teams can use an idea they had before the event. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be innovative . If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it s hard to find something that s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code). Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed.</td>

K H is intended to introduce HackCU participants and visitors to the world of amateur radio. What is Amateur Radio? Amateur radio (also known as ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings people, electronics and communication together. People use amateur radio to talk across town, around the world, or even into space. It s fun, social, educational, and can be a lifeline during times of need. Although amateur radio operators get involved for many reasons, they all have in common a basic knowledge of radio technology and operating principles, and pass an examination for a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission. This license enables them to use radio frequencies to reach out to the world and beyond. You do not need to learn Morse code to earn an amateur radio license.</td>

                            <td>Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it s okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed. Projects that violate the MLH s Code of Conduct or HackCU s Code of Conduct are not allowed. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking MLH s Code of Conduct , breaking HackCU s Code of Conduct , or other unsporting behaviour. Demos After hacking finishes, teams will show their projects each other and to the judges. You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built.</td>
