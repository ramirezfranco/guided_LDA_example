We never did, but it was cool. With Foursqwhere, we wanted to understand what checkins told us about communities we re a part of, like NYU. We started tracking checkins at 100 NYU buildings to sort of figure out where students are going the most and who was the NYU-wide mayor. So basically we created an NYU-specific Foursquare, including our own badges. An RA at an NYU dorm informed us of a Foursquare night they were hosting with a Foursquare engineer. We were also featured in NYU Local and mentioned in TechCrunch during the hackathon.

4632962,https://hackny.org/2011/06/andres-campanella-techcrunch-disrupt-hackathon-winner/,"It s just following primitive ideas based on the little bit I ve read about body language, proximity, and finding the sweet spot between two people. If the point was creating long-lasting relationships maybe the approach would be different and would encourage you to be a little gentler in your approach. I used Open CV to track clothing color on two people. Open CV has libraries that do color tracking for you with handful of exciting matrix operations. I had never worked with Open CV before but a bunch of people very helpful, especially the Aviary guys, who were very supportive and helped me find resources to operate it. This is what the first version of the hack looked like: After the hackathon, I got help from with my friends Tengchao Zhou and Joe Saavedra to polish it up more before the final presentation during the conference. Joe is good with electrical engineering and helped add a sweat sensor, breath rate sensor and heart sensor.","Joe Saavedra, Tengchao Zhou, Joe",,

We also added a kill switch. If your date is beyond recovery, it gives you a phone call pretending to be your mom with medical emergency so can excuse yourself. How was presenting? The first presentation was very scary. I m not much of a performer in that way and have terrible stage fright. I was shaking before I went on stage. I curse a lot when I m nervous and this was only my second time presenting at a hackathon. I guess it can be charming sometimes if everyone is well-spoken and you try to be vulgar it can move people around sometimes. I was very scared. I didn t want to memorize anything since I was so nervous and feared that if I got off track I d have to start from the beginning and would look like a dick.",Tengchao,,

I came up with an idea where I wanted to leverage the Beanbag API by setting up beanbags to mimic the first stage to the right of Yoshi s house in Super Mario World. I had taken the entire level, laid it out and scaled in in terms of beanbag placement. I wanted to have the camera and use a tracking token for an actor to have him jump across beanbags as if he was Mario and track it in an emulator in a hack-y sort of way. (Class of 2011 hackNY Fellow) Abe Stanway and I were working on it and then someone told us something similar had been done before at last year s hackathon.

The idea is that when friends log in, they can make lists of places they ve been, so if I made list of best pizza places I can mark off place I ve been and see where I haven t yet been. Another thing I can do is text the name of my list to it and it ll add in the last place I checked in into that list. We got 60 to 70 people who created lists and got a few write-ups, including in About Foursqure . Didn t you do another Foursquare hack recently?

Onreel.news lets users track developing stories around the world in real-time through videos taken by direct witnesses. The site, which is live, currently simulates what Onreel.news users would see the night of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. This hack idea came out of the frustration of not knowing where to find raw, unedited footage taken by those who were experiencing world news first-hand, said team member Tiffany Jiang. The competition, which took place over three days in late November at Facebook s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, featured 78 finalists representing 21 teams from 11 countries.

Some were 50-person companies with heavy investment while others had little more than prototypes with 1-minute demos (after time expired, they got gonged).

I noticed the other Fellows were, too, and in between demos we would discuss the products, the presenters, and how we would ve done it differently.

Hacks often used to stand out being technologically awesome. Today, the ones that stood out were conceptually awesome. The students did not sacrifice quality, with the prolific production demonstrating greatness in both number and gnarliness. The crowd favorites were all over the computing spectrum. One team produced ncnyt , an ncurses frontend for the New York Times and posted it on the Cheese Shop, meaning I ll never have to leave my terminal window again. Another made Discofy , a Spotify playlist generation app based on the classic game of selecting a song based on one word from the artist or title before it.

Revealing oneself as a 4channer, one of the nicer names for a frequenter of 4chan.org , a popular anonymous message board, is a dangerous thing. If it happens in person, one is apt to get either confused looks or nervous laughter and a quick change-of-subject in response. If it happens online, one is often labeled one of the less-pleasant names for a 4channer and judged accordingly. People tend to think that 4chan is a hive of reprehensible behavior enabled by total anonymity and they re not entirely wrong.","Emmett Butler, Chris Wiggins, Chris Poole, Menu Blog About Fellows",NYC,

In shorter events, teachers can help their student teams develop their class project ideas in a compressed time-frame. The project wrap-up phase amps up the motivation and emotions while at the same time turns the focus towards presenting a finished project to the other attendees and judges. Each team takes a few minutes to describe the problem they have addressed, their plan of action and the results of their project. Once each team has made their short presentation, the judges typically confer in private in order to sort out their top picks. While a 4 hour jam might result in hand drawn sketches of concepts, targets, processes and resource requirements, a 4 day event might feature working prototypes.

She took the classes for pure enjoyment and the satisfaction of learning to master the instrument. Her passion for conga drumming is not surprising. When Borman is interested in something, she gives it her all. Not long after joining the computer security club, RPISEC, Borman realized that some students including her would do better in a more introductory environment. The material was designed for a more advanced student, she said. We were being thrown in too deep, too quickly. Some students were intimidated and left. Borman opted for a different approach. Along with a fellow student, she founded an offshoot organization called IntroSec, and developed a series of lectures and supplemental materials to help students fill in the gaps. That work led to an invitation to present at a hackathon sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery s Council on Women in Computing.","IntroSec, RPISEC, the Association for Computing Machinery s Council on Women in Computing, Borman",,

First, the much-loved local fellowship program got ambassadors from the likes of Pivotal Labs, Foursquare, Code Academy, Twilio and Google ( But I m not here officially, said the rep who shall not be named) to hold office hours during the hackathon. They were on hand to help bleary-eyed hackers running on RedBull with the finer points of MongoDB and JavaScript. Then we heard 10gen, Kevin Ryan s most promising investment, was sponsoring buses to pick up coders all the way from schools like RISD, Carnegie Mellon, and UPenn. But the real clincher was that the hackathon was organized using the Hacker League, which was itself a hack cobbled together last week by three students from Rutgers who skipped class to get it ready in time.","UPenn, Kevin Ryan, Foursquare, Carnegie Mellon, MongoDB, Code Academy, JavaScript, RISD, Pivotal Labs, Rutgers, Biggest Hackathon, the Hacker League",Twilio,

First, the much-loved local fellowship program got ambassadors from the likes of Pivotal Labs, Foursquare, Code Academy, Twilio and Google ( But I m not here officially, said the rep who shall not be named) to hold office hours during the hackathon. They were on hand to help bleary-eyed hackers running on RedBull with the finer points of MongoDB and JavaScript. Then we heard 10gen, Kevin Ryan s most promising investment, was sponsoring buses to pick up coders all the way from schools like RISD, Carnegie Mellon, and UPenn. But the real clincher was that the hackathon was organized using the Hacker League, which was itself a hack cobbled together last week by three students from Rutgers who skipped class to get it ready in time.","UPenn, Kevin Ryan, Foursquare, Carnegie Mellon, MongoDB, Code Academy, JavaScript, RISD, Pivotal Labs, Rutgers, Biggest Hackathon, the Hacker League",Twilio,

The rules of the competition The maximum number of hackers per team is limited to 4.

All work on a project should be done at the hackathon. Teams can use an idea they had before the event. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be innovative . If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it s hard to find something that s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code). Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.

People use amateur radio to talk across town, around the world, or even into space. It s fun, social, educational, and can be a lifeline during times of need. Although amateur radio operators get involved for many reasons, they all have in common a basic knowledge of radio technology and operating principles, and pass an examination for a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission. This license enables them to use radio frequencies to reach out to the world and beyond.

A week after Emmett s workshop on game development using cocos2d and box2d, I gave my own workshop about making 3d games in unity . Unity is a free 3d game engine that allows one to build games for several different platforms, including desktop (windows/osx) and mobile (ios/android). The scripting framework is built on mono, an open source implementation of the .NET framework. Although the main language is c#, unity also supports unityscript (its own variant of javascript) and boo (a language inspired by python and developed for .NET/mono). For the workshop, I decided to show hackNY Fellows how to build a simple first-person 3d platformer.","Unity, 3d, David Coss, Chris Wiggins, Emmett, cocos2d, Menu Blog About Fellows",NYC,

Our student hackathon was the first of its kind in NYC (est. 2010) and it remains the most popular in New York City. We look forward to our 15th(!) hackathon this spring at NYU. The hackNY Fellowship completed its 7th class, the 2016 Class of hackNY Fellows were an amazing cohort, interning at 20 different NYC startups this summer, housed together in Union Square. They were also our most diverse ever, with 40% women and 60% people of color.","eric wu, Menu Blog About Fellows Hackathon Newsletter Press, The hackNY Fellowship, NYU","New York City, NYC",

If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't intermittently lob advice across the room. This can lead to the ""too many cooks"" problem, but more importantly, it can be rude and disruptive to half-participate in work that isn t yours. Be mindful that certain content and actions can make the people around you uncomfortable. If your hack contains material that might cross a boundary, talk to an organizer or team member. They'll review it with the team and notify you if you should go forward or make some appropriate changes. Don't waste time on a hack that won't be allowed to demo. All members of a team must be physically present during the entirety of the event to be considered for prizes . There will be no alcohol or drugs allowed at the event. Have fun.

Two of the judges, Dave McClure and Stephen Anderson , complimented Cemre s pitch deck. TripMedi shared the first place title with WalkIn from the Silicon Valley bus. After finals, Cemre found he needed 10-12 hours of sleep per night. While it was happening, I didn t feel it that much because I was so excited about the work I was doing, he said, but now I m sleepy all the time. This was Cemre s first hackathon, and he said time management was his biggest challenge.","Dave McClure, StartupBus, TripMedi, Cemre, Stephen Anderson, WalkIn",,

Employees from NYC startups came to present their APIs to the students and mentor them throughout the weekend, including Buzzfeed , MongoDB , Foursquare , Clarifai and Giphy . Hacks included both useful and funny webapps, simulations and educational material using civic data, a hilarious but politically relevant game, and innovative hardware hacks using drones, Oculus Rifts and Arduinos.
