For a couple of the winning teams, their members came solo and found their new teams and friends at the hackathon. That s what we love to see!

For 24 hours from Saturday into Sunday, over 240 hackers from nearly 50 different colleges built apps to help you fight procrastination, hacked hardware to help save energy, made memes more accessible, and questioned the correct pronunciation of gif (it s definitely with a hard G). Over 40 enthusiastic teams presented their 90 second demos to the judges and audiences and showed just how creative, determined and innovative they could be. We started the weekend off with technology presentations from NYC companies Clarifai , Giphy , ProPublica , NYTimes , Foursquare , Buzzfeed , Twilio during opening ceremonies.</td>

A group of over 200 dedicated students produced some of the best hacks we ve ever seen. We noticed an extra focus on social good this season, with hacks to protect schools from guns, make online communities safer, bring education to those without resources, and help the world be more accessible to those with disabilities. For a couple of the winning teams, their members came solo and found their new teams and friends at the hackathon. That s what we love to see! The Spring 2016 hackers represented over 70 universities, with students coming from as far away as Chicago and Florida to work on projects.</td>

Meals and snacks were plentiful throughout the weekend, with hackers enjoying italian, thai, Kings Kolaches, Veselka and Insomnia Cookies, among others. Our traditional Ladies Storm Hackathons meetup was as fulfilling as always, with women gathering to relax and share their experiences. They discovered many similarities, like the struggle to find mentors, interest in studying abroad, and ideas about integrating interdisciplinary skills into their technology careers. They discussed some of the most difficult issues facing women in the world of technology. At the end, the LSH hackers left with a sense of solidarity, new friends and mentors, and (of course) cupcakes!</td>

In addition to holding twice annual student hackathons, each summer hackNY organizes the hackNY fellows program: a program that pairs quantitative and computational students with startups which can demonstrate a strong mentoring environment: a problem for a student to work on, a person to mentor them, and a place for them to work. Students enjoy free housing together and a pedagogical lecture series to introduce them to the ins and outs of joining and founding a startup. On Friday, the program culminated with the hackNY DemoFest ( watch here ) and on Saturday, I took the bus home for the summer. Accordingly, I thought I d write a little about my experience, so the internet can know how amazing the program really is.

Menu Blog About Fellows Hackathon Newsletter Press Tag: Buzzfeed hackNY Summer Series: Jonah Peretti June 12, 2012 June 12, 2012 by Chris Wiggins , posted in Blog In this post 2012 hackNY Fellow Samuel Stern describes the hackNY Summer Series lecture by Jonah Peretti of Buzzfeed . Last week the HackNY fellows got to hear from Johan Peretti, founding member of The Huffington Post and current CEO of BuzzFeed. I thought this was an awesome talk, so I decided I d write this week s HackNY blog post and talk about what I took away from the experience. First of all, the most interesting part about Jonah was that he is not a hacker in the traditional sense. He never (to my knowledge) built any world-changing software or took down a famous website. Instead, he is a social hacker with an incredible understanding of how to properly utilize technology.</td>

We had over 50 teams demo their hacks to our team of judges, which included developers, entrepreneurs, and the CTO of the City of New York! You can learn more about our 5 inspiring judges in last week s blog post .

During the summer, you&#39;ll have the opportunity to meet all the Fellows at a mixer, and to celebrate their graduation at our annual Demo Night. The Details: If you are successfully matched with a hackNY Fellow: Host startups pay at least $1,000/week for 10 weeks to the Fellow and $4,200 to hackNY, which covers the direct cost of hosting their Fellow (housing and summer programming). As in previous years, hackNY works to support all scales of NYC startups and will be providing aid to startups which can show evidence of a strong mentoring environment but for which this commitment is incompatible with the current level of funding.</td>

The internship, speaker series, and meeting other fellows seemed cool, but not to the level of excitement every past fellow radiated. Now after experiencing a little bit of hackNY, that excitement is starting to make sense. I ve fallen in love with how my hackNY class truly grills each amazing speaker we hear from. These hard questions lead to true and honest insight from speakers, which makes the talks so much better than the glorified sugar coated large auditorium presentations I am used to. I knew I would love working for a small and exciting start up, but I thought I was only going to be able to help on the technical side. I had no idea I would also be trusted with contributing to significant business and strategic decisions. Another priceless value hackNY has made possible.</td>

The powers that be scored us some super-awesome New York Tech Meetup tickets Tuesday night, and we were all too happy to take them up on the offer. We definitely appreciated the hackNY love coming from all corners in the Skirball Center (although I might add we got a bit too much love from the headhunters sitting behind us!) The meetup was a good time, though we saw some pretty great demos, including my personal favorite, HowAboutWe , which lets users list potential dates for others to accept. Yes, I signed up, and no, I haven t been asked out yet. After the meetup, we got burgers at Stand 4 . Much meat was eaten, to the dismay of the nice fedora-ed waiter.</td>

During the summer, you&#39;ll have the opportunity to meet all the Fellows at a mixer, and to celebrate their graduation at our annual Demo Night. The Details: If you are successfully matched with a hackNY Fellow: Host startups pay at least $1,000/week for 10 weeks to the Fellow and $4,200 to hackNY, which covers the direct cost of hosting their Fellow (housing and summer programming). As in previous years, hackNY works to support all scales of NYC startups and will be providing aid to startups which can show evidence of a strong mentoring environment but for which this commitment is incompatible with the current level of funding.</td>

At the beginning of hackNY student hackathons, New York City startups selected by the student organizing committee demo their APIs. Students then form teams to brainstorm ideas for projects to build based on these APIs, working through the night to turn their ideas into reality in time to present before a panel of judges the following day, competing for prizes and glory.</td>

Employment in tech firms rose 28% between 2005 and 2010 according to the City Economic Corporation. But even with all those hires, tech companies face a man power shortage when it comes to programmers. hackNY an initiative founded by computer science professors at Columbia and NYU are trying to fix that.

Matching talented developers with leading entrepreneurs is a smart way to build New York City s technology sector and encourage innovation, so it s no surprise that New York City institutions are leading the way with programs like hackNY to do just that, said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. hackNY s expansion is just the latest example of the growing collaboration between entrepreneurs, universities and investors that is key to driving further growth in New York City s thriving technology sector.</td>

Like hackNY, GenTech nurtures the next generation of technologists and entrepreneurs. GenTech s free summer program gives curious, motivated public high school students from all five boroughs hands-on experience in building and shipping. GenTech students take a mini-bootcamp in frontend code, imagine an app that helps their communities, learn to pitch and collaborate, and work with mentors from top companies to prototype their mobile apps. As with hackNY s summer fellowship, the students also get incredible private tours and lectures tours of Warby Parker and Google , and CEO and VC talks and make lifelong friendships with peers who want to change the world by building new things.</td>

She discussed her life, unique career path, and how venture capital fits into tech startups. Ann led the fellows through her career, beginning with her time as an electrical engineering undergraduate at Yale. Fortuitously offered the opportunity to shadow Lew Platt , CEO of Hewlett-Packard at the time, she developed a taste for business and switched gears to jobs outside of engineering. Ann spent a summer as an intern at Goldman Sachs, then several years as a management consultant at McKinsey. After McKinsey, she moved on to work in venture capital at Charles River Ventures. Investing in the economy-low of 2001-2003 proved slow, however, and after two years, Ann felt it was time to return to school for her PhD at Stanford.</td>

Ideally I ll work 4 days a week so I have extra days for my own projects. I m guessing I ll be working the next year, maybe less, maybe more. I m also looking at applying to an incubator like TechStars or Y Combinator. Hopefully they ve heard of hackNY. Finding work hasn t been too hard. I think hackNY helps, I honestly think that. I don t have a resume, and I don t plan on having one. Right now I have four separate discussions about gigs going with people, and all but one are thanks to hackNY. I m open to anything. The job I ll take will be for web development, probably for a startup, or maybe a web development shop.</td>

We listened to talks by two great technologists and artists, Tega Brain and David Scheinkopf , who told us about their recent work and inspired us to see tech, art, and education in new ways. Here are some photos from the event! AlumNY sit with their friends after dinner, listening to talks by local technologists and artists.</td>

Music-wise I ve been listening to a lot of psych/indie rock and electronic lately. Older stuff like Radiohead and newer stuff like Jamie xx. Do you have any advice for the hackers who want to apply to be hackNY Fellows? Make lots of side projects and submit a portfolio!

Menu Blog About Fellows Hackathon Newsletter Press HackMatch June 2, 2010 January 28, 2011 by Chris Wiggins , posted in Blog One of the principal goals of the hackNY initiative is to pair as many NYC student-hackers as possible with the tech startups in the growing NYC startup ecosystem. We had over 100 students apply to be interns and over 70 startups apply to host them . Thanks to The Kauffman Foundation , were able to fund twelve students as the 2010 hackNY Fellows , who we personally matched with their host startups, but given the large number of applicants, this approach clearly won t scale. To help with this we wrote HackMatch to help students and startups identify the best matches based on technological skills and needs. HackMatch provides for each startup a ranked list of students whose skillset most overlaps with their needs (and conversely for each student).</td>

In short, there isn t a specific reason for any one startup not being matched with a Fellow other than it didn t survive the above culling process. Were there more start-ups than the 100+ summer applicants? There were &gt;70 startups applying, but more students than startups. What can I expect from HackMatch?</td>

We had talks by many different startups and entrepreneurs who all taught us a little something different about being a tech entrepreneur and managing both small and growing companies. We also were educated on the financial side of tech startups by hearing from investors who each invest at a different stage in a startup s life. I gained invaluable knowledge about tech entrepreneurship from the speakers. Actually working for a NY tech startup was also a very big learning experience. I received first hand knowledge on how a tech startup functions, and during my time there also learning a bunch of programming practices and a bunch of computer science.</td>

Evan skating at a spot in Williamsburg What do you enjoy doing away from the keyboard? Skateboarding, music, film photography, travel. Despite the harsh winter weather in NYC, I ve been getting a few sessions here and there at the new Nike skatepark in Williamsburg. In the summer I usually skate LES a lot. I recently got an old school Canon AE-1 camera so I ve been having fun shooting around the city and when I m traveling. Music-wise I ve been listening to a lot of psych/indie rock and electronic lately. Older stuff like Radiohead and newer stuff like Jamie xx. Do you have any advice for the hackers who want to apply to be hackNY Fellows? Make lots of side projects and submit a portfolio! Work on stuff outside of class and find other people to hack on stuff with.</td>

NYC startups who are interested in hosting a talented and passionate technical intern should apply to host a Fellow. Hosting a hackNY Fellow is a great way to start your intern program. We provide housing, enriching activities, and technical and community mentorship to each Fellow. If you already have an intern program in place, hackNY&#39;s intern program will complement it well. We remove the stress of finding summer housing, and host activities outside work hours. How many Fellows and startups participate each year?</td>

I also loved living with and getting to know my brilliant HackNY companions, many of whom I consider great friends today.

Since then, besides all of the philosophical self-learning through life and growing up, I ve picked up a little bit of Swift through SpriteKit game development and have started to learn reactive programming paradigms through RxJava. In my last year of undergrad I learned a fair bit about computational fabrication (e.g. 3D printing), which was cool, and how to make cameraless films.

In his own words: I m excited and gratified to be joining HackNY! When I first met the hackNY crew in the spring of 2010 to help with their first hackathon, I was immediately impressed by their vision for connecting students and the New York City startup community, and it was clear that the students shared that that enthusiasm. Even coming from tech-heavy Silicon Valley, I could see back then that the NYC tech scene was already vibrant and rapidly gaining steam. Since then, the scene has only grown in strength, with startups blossoming all over the city, attracting world-class talent.</td>

Chad was my boss at Yahoo! for a time and he always extolled the virtues of the hack empowering people, getting out of the way, and letting them build awesome things. I ve tried to imbue this spirit of hack in my endeavors ever since in my experience, it always, always leads to good things. I m proud to be part of this organization that is empowering students and the NYC tech ecosystem.</td>

There were personalization engines such as Brom.ly an event activity recommender, and Dibsie a shopping site that recommends deals based on your preferences and on-site activity. There were also social tools like want! a mobile app that lets you share photos of things you spot in real life you d like to own, and KnowAboutIt a service that highlights the most personally relevant content shared in your social streams.</td>

I d already met Dave through a hackNY hackathon. He knew me and trusted me, so he offered me the TechStars job that the same day. So that s how I got the job, from building tables. The first time I met Dave was at the Fall 2010 hackathon. After that we emailed a bit, he met up with me and (fellow hackNY alum) Max Stoller , and we developed a relationship. I think part of it was that hackNY is a good validation so Dave didn t see us as a couple of schmucks, but rather hey these guys did hackNY, they must be good. What else are you up to?

Being a fellow in the hackNY program has given me valuable connections to the New York startup community and computer science students as well as a new programming skill-set to enhance my resume. Nolan Filter, NYU I cannot say enough good things about this program . The least of all of it is the technical aspect.

Working for Knewton was a great experience, both in learning real world skills in current technology and teamwork, and in getting a first-hand view of startup culture. After this summer, I would love to continue being a part of the startup scene. Stuart Partin, Columbia The hackNY fellowship was a very different and awesome learning experience for me. The visits to startup companies and chats with entrepreneurs were eye-opening (given I knew very little about the startup industry), especially the talks by Chris Dixon and by Jonah Perreti. The most exciting part, however, was working as part of the data team at OKCupid.</td>

Then, armed with these new technologies, their innate talents and creativity, and the most pizza, Red Bull, and burritos the Courant Institute has ever seen, students broke into teams to create their own applications and mashups. Student demos on Saturday night in front of local founders, developers, and investors blew everyone away. Three teams awarded special recognition then presented at the Tuesday April 6 New York Tech Meetup . We hope all these participating students will apply here for the hackNY internship program, and then tell all their friends to do so as well. Interested startups should apply here .

When I first met the hackNY crew in the spring of 2010 to help with their first hackathon, I was immediately impressed by their vision for connecting students and the New York City startup community, and it was clear that the students shared that that enthusiasm. Even coming from tech-heavy Silicon Valley, I could see back then that the NYC tech scene was already vibrant and rapidly gaining steam.

Chad was my boss at Yahoo! for a time and he always extolled the virtues of the hack empowering people, getting out of the way, and letting them build awesome things. I ve tried to imbue this spirit of hack in my endeavors ever since in my experience, it always, always leads to good things.

There are always new technologies to pickup or at least get exposed to, and there s no better opportunity than having fellows at New York s hottest startups teach each other what we know. So we created workshops that we hold once a week with two presenters covering something we think everyone else will want to learn. We re all experts in some area or another; workshops are how we share the wealth.</td>

Ian will be interning with Facebook this summer. Ian, what are you up to these days? I m going to school working on products I did before the summer, and working on my major. Recently I ve been working on b00st , the site I started after the Spring Hackathon. It s a social news site like Reddit, but in real time. As votes come in, the numbers go up on new comments in real time. I want to move news into that area. Can you tell us more about it?</td>

I won a little Statue of Liberty thing, a TechCrunch sticker and an Android phone that moot awarded me. That s my moot award, and I will treasure it forever and ever. Will you continue to work on it? i don t really know if I ll follow up. I ve got myself tied up with some research at NYU right now so I m dedicating myself to other projects right now.

Kyle Bragger introduced Forrst , a place for developers and designers to share their work and give each other assistance. It s invite-only for now, but the splash screen is so damn cool.

It was a great experience. How did we get there? We participated in (and won) the NYC Student Hackathon , which coincidentally was HackNY s inaugural event. At the Hackathon, over a dozen companies presented their APIs and swarms of students were given 24 hours to write the funkiest, most creative apps and pitch them to the crowd. It was a crash course in what all successful start-ups do: find an inventive, useful application that fulfills some need and show everybody why it s the next-best-thing. Back to the Tech Meetup on Tuesday: there were presenters at all stages of the startup cycle. Some were 50-person companies with heavy investment while others had little more than prototypes with 1-minute demos (after time expired, they got gonged).</td>

                            <td>The demos were interesting, sure, but HackNY has sharpened my vision and given me perspective: while the presenters were on stage, I was analyzing everything . I noticed the other Fellows were, too, and in between demos we would discuss the products, the presenters, and how we would ve done it differently. We re becoming comfortable with the process. hackNY is helping us take the tools we learn at our various schools and actually create something with them. I ll take that any day over working for some corporation. Sometimes you need to use the Internet to help yourself get off the internet. And sometimes you need people from academia to help you figure out what the hell you re gonna do with yourself after you leave academia . Before I go, some standouts from the Tech Meetup: ThumbPlay gave a sneak-peek of their next-generation online audio player, all written in HTML5.</td>

When we find a great match, we introduce you to the startup so you have the opportunity to learn more about one another. At this stage, the startup might do an interview or a tech screen to ensure you&#39;re the right fit for their team. They have the choice to accept or decline the match. Similarly, you may decline them if you feel like it s not the right fit. The large majority of our matches are successful on the first try, however if either party declines the match, we will rematch. This is a normal part of the process and we will do our best to make matches with the best chance of success for the summer.

As talented technologists, the hackNY summer fellows (and alumNY-mentors) are hackathon veterans who build side projects in their spare time. They all have software and hardware engineering expertise, whether that be in design, mobile development, web programming, systems infrastructure, or hardware. Applied to social good, these skills have the potential to effect massive change across a community or city, and indeed, we witnessed the fellows impact throughout the 10 weeks of the fellowship.</td>

This allowed our group to focus our efforts on our individual passions or directions. On the flip side, there was no one holding us accountable if we weren t able to deliver on our plans on time.

Dan says, It really makes you understand that volunteer work is not easy, and it definitely is work, but in the end, it s really great to be able to harness your skills and focus on a problem not just to make profit for a company, or solving technical problems for a product. You re solving actually meaningful problems. It s currently being used by Toronto and Ontario police departments, and combating human trafficking at NYPD.</td>

The resounding answer I got was two-fold: What defined hackNY s social good initiative was the teamwork and passion. As talented technologists, the hackNY summer fellows (and alumNY-mentors) are hackathon veterans who build side projects in their spare time. They all have software and hardware engineering expertise, whether that be in design, mobile development, web programming, systems infrastructure, or hardware. Applied to social good, these skills have the potential to effect massive change across a community or city, and indeed, we witnessed the fellows impact throughout the 10 weeks of the fellowship.</td>

As Bethany describes, The hackNY experience was different because we were spearheading the effort, whereas usually I would be reporting to someone else s vision or agenda. This allowed our group to focus our efforts on our individual passions or directions. On the flip side, there was no one holding us accountable if we weren t able to deliver on our plans on time. I liked that we had a lot of freedom to pursue whatever social good and whatever impact we wanted, and it was great that the other fellows were equally passionate about pursuing these issues.</td>

Yes, Facebook or Google are great, but I promise hackNY is an experience worth having. The NYC tech scene is growing extremely fast and in order for it to really flourish, we need as many talented engineers as possible. Programs like hackNY and the Turing Fellowship are taking real steps to providing this necessary resource.

The collective knowledge of 30+ HackNY fellows in one dorm is truly immense. I learned a ton of things outside my specific areas of focus just by talking to other fellows. The speaker series was also awesome. In specific, I loved hearing the talks from the Branch founders (Hursh and Cemre), Samantha John of Hopscotch, and the Codeacademy founders (Ryan and Zach). I left the fellowship basically just super inspired from hearing their stories. Evan and Oleksii Iepishkin, another Tapad engineer, at Spark Summit How has your company grown or changed since your hackNY summer? Tapad has doubled in headcount since I joined, so there s been a lot of change organizationally. With that amount of growth, more structure and internal processes have been added to keep everything running smoothly.</td>

Preface about HackNY Workshops: Eitan Adler and I were talking during the beginning of the fellowship program and we decided that we had to get something out of the fact that we were basically living with 30 other coders who could all each teach us something we didn t know. There are always new technologies to pickup or at least get exposed to, and there s no better opportunity than having fellows at New York s hottest startups teach each other what we know.</td>

There are always new technologies to pickup or at least get exposed to, and there s no better opportunity than having fellows at New York s hottest startups teach each other what we know. So we created workshops that we hold once a week with two presenters covering something we think everyone else will want to learn. We re all experts in some area or another; workshops are how we share the wealth. Wednesday evening it was my turn to present. I ve been doing some awesome work with (and learning all about) Node.js and Socket.io at OMGPOP , the startup I have been working at for five weeks.</td>

I m going to school working on products I did before the summer, and working on my major. Recently I ve been working on b00st , the site I started after the Spring Hackathon. It s a social news site like Reddit, but in real time. As votes come in, the numbers go up on new comments in real time. I want to move news into that area. Can you tell us more about it? I want to grow a large realtime community and see what possible features to introduce. It s a newer idea of community and the forum is like modern forum. PHPbb is old school and you can t really tell the difference between one forum and another. 4chan is similar to other image boards. Reddit and Digg look similar, too. I want to push the envelope a little bit, to innovate on that. What are you studying at Rutgers? I m an information technology major. I m more interested in how people use computers rather than how computers serve people.</td>

Now I m trying to focus my talents on front end stuff. I knew I was going this way because of the hacks I was doing. Hacks are either very technical or visual/cool. Most either show you data or a pretty finished Twitter clone or something. I was always trying the cooler, impressive-looking kinds of things rather than focusing on data crunching and performance. That s what I liked to do in my spare time. Also, when I applied to intern at Facebook, one of my professors said, I m gonna send you to the UX people. I asked him why and he said, That s where you ll fit in, that s exactly what you should do. He knows what I m good at and what I m bad at. I always liked doing design and creating ideas more than the actual execution.</td>

It was a smooth introduction to the startup world, with a lot of explanation of how it works. A lot of people say that with startups you don t know if the next day you ll have work. The program answered a lot of these concerns with real answers from people in the startup world. The range of all of the lectures we had was well thought out, and included speakers from the business side, the tech side, the social side with and the VC side. It gave us a brief introduction to all those sides, but a very complete one. It definitely helps to know how the VC world works, or have someone talk about it. It s not something that a university is going to teach you. It s something that should be taught earlier rather than just fighting with it the first time you need funding.</td>

Ian will be interning with Facebook this summer. Ian, what are you up to these days? I m going to school working on products I did before the summer, and working on my major. Recently I ve been working on b00st , the site I started after the Spring Hackathon. It s a social news site like Reddit, but in real time. As votes come in, the numbers go up on new comments in real time. I want to move news into that area. Can you tell us more about it?</td>

I came up with an idea where I wanted to leverage the Beanbag API by setting up beanbags to mimic the first stage to the right of Yoshi s house in Super Mario World. I had taken the entire level, laid it out and scaled in in terms of beanbag placement. I wanted to have the camera and use a tracking token for an actor to have him jump across beanbags as if he was Mario and track it in an emulator in a hack-y sort of way. (Class of 2011 hackNY Fellow) Abe Stanway and I were working on it and then someone told us something similar had been done before at last year s hackathon. So then I started wandering around like a lost soul for hours, looking over people s shoulders to see what they were working on.</td>

Joe is good with electrical engineering and helped add a sweat sensor, breath rate sensor and heart sensor. We also added tracking for loudness of voice using a microphone. Tengchao helped to make it look better. We also added a kill switch. If your date is beyond recovery, it gives you a phone call pretending to be your mom with medical emergency so can excuse yourself. How was presenting? The first presentation was very scary. I m not much of a performer in that way and have terrible stage fright. I was shaking before I went on stage. I curse a lot when I m nervous and this was only my second time presenting at a hackathon. I guess it can be charming sometimes if everyone is well-spoken and you try to be vulgar it can move people around sometimes. I was very scared.</td>

And they responded very well and laughed. I was afraid they would think it was an insult, but it takes a geek to know a geek. If I was insulting anyone, I was insulting myself. What did you win? I won a little Statue of Liberty thing, a TechCrunch sticker and an Android phone that moot awarded me. That s my moot award, and I will treasure it forever and ever. Will you continue to work on it? i don t really know if I ll follow up. I ve got myself tied up with some research at NYU right now so I m dedicating myself to other projects right now.

Each week, TechStars companies put in requests for me, and I pick one or two to work on for the week. That s the job end of it. I also just get to be a part of the TechStars program.

We never did, but it was cool. With Foursqwhere, we wanted to understand what checkins told us about communities we re a part of, like NYU. We started tracking checkins at 100 NYU buildings to sort of figure out where students are going the most and who was the NYU-wide mayor. So basically we created an NYU-specific Foursquare, including our own badges. An RA at an NYU dorm informed us of a Foursquare night they were hosting with a Foursquare engineer. We were also featured in NYU Local and mentioned in TechCrunch during the hackathon. Also, Frank Rimalovski (NYU Venture Fund managing director) caught wind of the project and invited us to participate at a technology expo in November.

All in all, there were about 15 of the 28 hackNY fellows working on this project. For Dan, this was his first time getting involved in volunteering and social good efforts. Dan says, It really makes you understand that volunteer work is not easy, and it definitely is work, but in the end, it s really great to be able to harness your skills and focus on a problem not just to make profit for a company, or solving technical problems for a product. You re solving actually meaningful problems. It s currently being used by Toronto and Ontario police departments, and combating human trafficking at NYPD.</td>

The resounding answer I got was two-fold: What defined hackNY s social good initiative was the teamwork and passion. As talented technologists, the hackNY summer fellows (and alumNY-mentors) are hackathon veterans who build side projects in their spare time. They all have software and hardware engineering expertise, whether that be in design, mobile development, web programming, systems infrastructure, or hardware. Applied to social good, these skills have the potential to effect massive change across a community or city, and indeed, we witnessed the fellows impact throughout the 10 weeks of the fellowship.</td>

As it pertains to the social good initiative, the fellows and mentors were proactive and passionate about leading and taking charge of their projects. As Bethany describes, The hackNY experience was different because we were spearheading the effort, whereas usually I would be reporting to someone else s vision or agenda. This allowed our group to focus our efforts on our individual passions or directions. On the flip side, there was no one holding us accountable if we weren t able to deliver on our plans on time. I liked that we had a lot of freedom to pursue whatever social good and whatever impact we wanted, and it was great that the other fellows were equally passionate about pursuing these issues.</td>

This was my first summer in tech, but after talking with other fellows, I can honestly say that this is an unbeatable experience. Yes, Facebook or Google are great, but I promise hackNY is an experience worth having. The NYC tech scene is growing extremely fast and in order for it to really flourish, we need as many talented engineers as possible. Programs like hackNY and the Turing Fellowship are taking real steps to providing this necessary resource. So, I urge you to apply for the hackNY fellowship program when applications open in the fall. Hopefully I ll be back in the city next year as a mentor and we ll get to hang! Also, attend the hackNY Fall hackathon on September 29-30th. p.s. if you enjoyed reading this, you should check out the rest of my blog and follow me on twitter .</td>

This winter, we re be profiling some hackNY AlumNY who have continued to do great things at the startup where they spent their hackNY Fellowship summer. In our last post, Lisa Luo (hackNY 14) told us all about her experience building an Android team at Kickstarter check it out. In this post we interview Evan Casey (Class of 2014 ), who interned at Tapad on the Data Team. In Evan s words, Tapad is a marketing technology company that uses algorithms to analyze internet and device data and predict whether two or more devices are owned by the same person.

I met some of my best friends in NYC through HackNY. During the fellowship, if I had an idea of something I wanted to hack on, I could find someone to work with on it pretty much whenever. I loved that. The collective knowledge of 30+ HackNY fellows in one dorm is truly immense. I learned a ton of things outside my specific areas of focus just by talking to other fellows. The speaker series was also awesome. In specific, I loved hearing the talks from the Branch founders (Hursh and Cemre), Samantha John of Hopscotch, and the Codeacademy founders (Ryan and Zach). I left the fellowship basically just super inspired from hearing their stories.

This week s workshop saw Fellow Grant Kot give an introduction to the world of HTML5 animation. Using the Javascript library Gee.js , Grant got the fellows up and running in minutes, animating basic spinning circles and Pacman-like figures with HTML5 s Canvas support. Fellows were quick to play around with and hack the basic commands Grant introduced, producing interesting animations to everyone s delight. Following Grant s presentation, Aaron Marks (your humble author) gave a talk on a less technical matter: Email productivity hacks. Specifically, instruction was given on how to be a Gmail power user, taking advantage of keyboard navigation, email address hacking, and filters.</td>

If you want to see the NYC tech scene flourish, share this piece with your networks and encourage any students you know to check out hackNY . If you re a student, read this and consider applying for the fellowship when applications open in September. I promise you that it is one of the best things you can do (according to one fellow, I can CONFIRM that hackNY Google ). I m Jesse Pollak, a student at Pomona College.

This was my first summer in tech, but after talking with other fellows, I can honestly say that this is an unbeatable experience. Yes, Facebook or Google are great, but I promise hackNY is an experience worth having. The NYC tech scene is growing extremely fast and in order for it to really flourish, we need as many talented engineers as possible. Programs like hackNY and the Turing Fellowship are taking real steps to providing this necessary resource. So, I urge you to apply for the hackNY fellowship program when applications open in the fall. Hopefully I ll be back in the city next year as a mentor and we ll get to hang! Also, attend the hackNY Fall hackathon on September 29-30th. p.s. if you enjoyed reading this, you should check out the rest of my blog and follow me on twitter .</td>

I used Open CV to track clothing color on two people. Open CV has libraries that do color tracking for you with handful of exciting matrix operations. I had never worked with Open CV before but a bunch of people very helpful, especially the Aviary guys, who were very supportive and helped me find resources to operate it. This is what the first version of the hack looked like: After the hackathon, I got help from with my friends Tengchao Zhou and Joe Saavedra to polish it up more before the final presentation during the conference. Joe is good with electrical engineering and helped add a sweat sensor, breath rate sensor and heart sensor.</td>

Tal Safran, HackStar Tal Safran spent his hackNY Summer Fellowship working with Aviary . He has also participated in each of the hackNY Student Hackathons . These days, Tal continues to code, working for TechStars, hacking at the Foursquare API, and exploring post-graduation opportunities. Hi, Tal. What are you up to these days? I am working for TechStars . They re a startup incubator with 11 companies. I m here as a HackStar , basically an in-house developer. A lot of their teams only have one or two developers, so they can use as much help as they can get.</td>

Each week, TechStars companies put in requests for me, and I pick one or two to work on for the week. That s the job end of it. I also just get to be a part of the TechStars program. They have a lot of speakers and mentors come in, so it s a very good learning experience. The programming work is also a great learning experience since I get to hop around different technologies. It s like, oh they re using Node.js so I get to learn that now. Tal&#39;s secret hacking strategy: Going shoeless How did you get involved? TechStars is in Pivotal Labs offices, and in January they needed extra people to set the office up for cash. I had no gig at the time and came in.</td>

I d already met Dave through a hackNY hackathon. He knew me and trusted me, so he offered me the TechStars job that the same day. So that s how I got the job, from building tables. The first time I met Dave was at the Fall 2010 hackathon. After that we emailed a bit, he met up with me and (fellow hackNY alum) Max Stoller , and we developed a relationship. I think part of it was that hackNY is a good validation so Dave didn t see us as a couple of schmucks, but rather hey these guys did hackNY, they must be good. What else are you up to? I m also working on some side projects involving lots of Rails, and a lot of front end design. I participated in the Foursqure hackathon a couple weeks ago. Me, Max, Steve and Kate made a lists hack for Foursquare. It was made in not even a full day of work so it s pretty barebones.</td>

Another thing I can do is text the name of my list to it and it ll add in the last place I checked in into that list. We got 60 to 70 people who created lists and got a few write-ups, including in About Foursqure . Didn t you do another Foursquare hack recently? Max and I created Foursqwhere at the Fall hackathon and presented it there. It still kind of works, but parts are broken now. We didn t win and were were really disappointed, but we made a few improvements to it anyway after the hackathon. About two weeks afterwards, we showed it at the New York Tech Meetup and got really good responses from people, including a Foursquare engineer who reached out to us and invited us to come to Foursquare headquarters. We never did, but it was cool.</td>

We started tracking checkins at 100 NYU buildings to sort of figure out where students are going the most and who was the NYU-wide mayor. So basically we created an NYU-specific Foursquare, including our own badges. An RA at an NYU dorm informed us of a Foursquare night they were hosting with a Foursquare engineer. We were also featured in NYU Local and mentioned in TechCrunch during the hackathon. Also, Frank Rimalovski (NYU Venture Fund managing director) caught wind of the project and invited us to participate at a technology expo in November. Were were the only undergrads presenting there. For both of these projects, we had random people emailing us who were interested, and we met some good people as a result. Foursqwhere&#39;s tech expo sign How s school going?

A lot of internships start and end that that s it. But for anybody who s been accepted or considering applying, I d say do it without thinking twice.

Tal Safran is Officially a Hacking Star March 10, 2011 September 21, 2011 by matylda , posted in Blog Note: This is the first in a Where Are They Now series profiling the continued awesomeness of our 2010 hackNY Summer Fellows. Tal Safran, HackStar Tal Safran spent his hackNY Summer Fellowship working with Aviary . He has also participated in each of the hackNY Student Hackathons . These days, Tal continues to code, working for TechStars, hacking at the Foursquare API, and exploring post-graduation opportunities. Hi, Tal. What are you up to these days? I am working for TechStars . They re a startup incubator with 11 companies. I m here as a HackStar , basically an in-house developer. A lot of their teams only have one or two developers, so they can use as much help as they can get.</td>

Sometimes they re building out a huge feature and need another person, sometimes, I grab designs and mark them up, and sometimes they just need an extra hand. Each week, TechStars companies put in requests for me, and I pick one or two to work on for the week. That s the job end of it. I also just get to be a part of the TechStars program. They have a lot of speakers and mentors come in, so it s a very good learning experience. The programming work is also a great learning experience since I get to hop around different technologies. It s like, oh they re using Node.js so I get to learn that now. Tal&#39;s secret hacking strategy: Going shoeless How did you get involved? TechStars is in Pivotal Labs offices, and in January they needed extra people to set the office up for cash. I had no gig at the time and came in.</td>

I d already met Dave through a hackNY hackathon. He knew me and trusted me, so he offered me the TechStars job that the same day. So that s how I got the job, from building tables. The first time I met Dave was at the Fall 2010 hackathon. After that we emailed a bit, he met up with me and (fellow hackNY alum) Max Stoller , and we developed a relationship. I think part of it was that hackNY is a good validation so Dave didn t see us as a couple of schmucks, but rather hey these guys did hackNY, they must be good. What else are you up to? I m also working on some side projects involving lots of Rails, and a lot of front end design. I participated in the Foursqure hackathon a couple weeks ago. Me, Max, Steve and Kate made a lists hack for Foursquare. It was made in not even a full day of work so it s pretty barebones.</td>

Another thing I can do is text the name of my list to it and it ll add in the last place I checked in into that list. We got 60 to 70 people who created lists and got a few write-ups, including in About Foursqure . Didn t you do another Foursquare hack recently? Max and I created Foursqwhere at the Fall hackathon and presented it there. It still kind of works, but parts are broken now. We didn t win and were were really disappointed, but we made a few improvements to it anyway after the hackathon. About two weeks afterwards, we showed it at the New York Tech Meetup and got really good responses from people, including a Foursquare engineer who reached out to us and invited us to come to Foursquare headquarters. We never did, but it was cool.</td>

We started tracking checkins at 100 NYU buildings to sort of figure out where students are going the most and who was the NYU-wide mayor. So basically we created an NYU-specific Foursquare, including our own badges. An RA at an NYU dorm informed us of a Foursquare night they were hosting with a Foursquare engineer. We were also featured in NYU Local and mentioned in TechCrunch during the hackathon. Also, Frank Rimalovski (NYU Venture Fund managing director) caught wind of the project and invited us to participate at a technology expo in November. Were were the only undergrads presenting there. For both of these projects, we had random people emailing us who were interested, and we met some good people as a result. Foursqwhere&#39;s tech expo sign How s school going?

A lot of internships start and end that that s it. But for anybody who s been accepted or considering applying, I d say do it without thinking twice.

Tal Safran is Officially a Hacking Star March 10, 2011 September 21, 2011 by matylda , posted in Blog Note: This is the first in a Where Are They Now series profiling the continued awesomeness of our 2010 hackNY Summer Fellows. Tal Safran, HackStar Tal Safran spent his hackNY Summer Fellowship working with Aviary . He has also participated in each of the hackNY Student Hackathons . These days, Tal continues to code, working for TechStars, hacking at the Foursquare API, and exploring post-graduation opportunities. Hi, Tal. What are you up to these days? I am working for TechStars . They re a startup incubator with 11 companies. I m here as a HackStar , basically an in-house developer. A lot of their teams only have one or two developers, so they can use as much help as they can get.</td>

Sometimes they re building out a huge feature and need another person, sometimes, I grab designs and mark them up, and sometimes they just need an extra hand. Each week, TechStars companies put in requests for me, and I pick one or two to work on for the week. That s the job end of it. I also just get to be a part of the TechStars program. They have a lot of speakers and mentors come in, so it s a very good learning experience. The programming work is also a great learning experience since I get to hop around different technologies. It s like, oh they re using Node.js so I get to learn that now. Tal&#39;s secret hacking strategy: Going shoeless How did you get involved? TechStars is in Pivotal Labs offices, and in January they needed extra people to set the office up for cash. I had no gig at the time and came in.</td>

I d already met Dave through a hackNY hackathon. He knew me and trusted me, so he offered me the TechStars job that the same day. So that s how I got the job, from building tables. The first time I met Dave was at the Fall 2010 hackathon. After that we emailed a bit, he met up with me and (fellow hackNY alum) Max Stoller , and we developed a relationship. I think part of it was that hackNY is a good validation so Dave didn t see us as a couple of schmucks, but rather hey these guys did hackNY, they must be good. What else are you up to? I m also working on some side projects involving lots of Rails, and a lot of front end design. I participated in the Foursqure hackathon a couple weeks ago. Me, Max, Steve and Kate made a lists hack for Foursquare. It was made in not even a full day of work so it s pretty barebones.</td>

Another thing I can do is text the name of my list to it and it ll add in the last place I checked in into that list. We got 60 to 70 people who created lists and got a few write-ups, including in About Foursqure . Didn t you do another Foursquare hack recently? Max and I created Foursqwhere at the Fall hackathon and presented it there. It still kind of works, but parts are broken now. We didn t win and were were really disappointed, but we made a few improvements to it anyway after the hackathon. About two weeks afterwards, we showed it at the New York Tech Meetup and got really good responses from people, including a Foursquare engineer who reached out to us and invited us to come to Foursquare headquarters. We never did, but it was cool.</td>

                            <td>With Foursqwhere, we wanted to understand what checkins told us about communities we re a part of, like NYU. We started tracking checkins at 100 NYU buildings to sort of figure out where students are going the most and who was the NYU-wide mayor. So basically we created an NYU-specific Foursquare, including our own badges. An RA at an NYU dorm informed us of a Foursquare night they were hosting with a Foursquare engineer. We were also featured in NYU Local and mentioned in TechCrunch during the hackathon. Also, Frank Rimalovski (NYU Venture Fund managing director) caught wind of the project and invited us to participate at a technology expo in November. Were were the only undergrads presenting there. For both of these projects, we had random people emailing us who were interested, and we met some good people as a result. Foursqwhere&#39;s tech expo sign How s school going?

A lot of internships start and end that that s it. But for anybody who s been accepted or considering applying, I d say do it without thinking twice. It s more than just a summer job, it s expanding your network and meeting people who will be there year round to help you and listen to you if you want to talk to them about tech stuff. It s really cool. And there s a lot of free food. Thanks, Tal!</td>

One team produced ncnyt , an ncurses frontend for the New York Times and posted it on the Cheese Shop, meaning I ll never have to leave my terminal window again.

The Speakers Series is a hackNY tradition in which the Fellows (sometimes along with alumNY) gather twice a week to hear from influential people in the tech world.</td>

Our student hackathon was the first of its kind in NYC (est. 2010) and it remains the most popular in New York City. We look forward to our 15th(!) hackathon this spring at NYU. The hackNY Fellowship completed its 7th class, the 2016 Class of hackNY Fellows were an amazing cohort, interning at 20 different NYC startups this summer, housed together in Union Square. They were also our most diverse ever, with 40% women and 60% people of color.</td>

The meetup was a good time, though we saw some pretty great demos, including my personal favorite, HowAboutWe , which lets users list potential dates for others to accept.

Back to the Tech Meetup on Tuesday: there were presenters at all stages of the startup cycle. Some were 50-person companies with heavy investment while others had little more than prototypes with 1-minute demos (after time expired, they got gonged). The demos were interesting, sure, but HackNY has sharpened my vision and given me perspective: while the presenters were on stage, I was analyzing everything . I noticed the other Fellows were, too, and in between demos we would discuss the products, the presenters, and how we would ve done it differently.

The first time I met Dave was at the Fall 2010 hackathon. After that we emailed a bit, he met up with me and (fellow hackNY alum) Max Stoller , and we developed a relationship.

A lot of internships start and end that that s it. But for anybody who s been accepted or considering applying, I d say do it without thinking twice. It s more than just a summer job, it s expanding your network and meeting people who will be there year round to help you and listen to you if you want to talk to them about tech stuff. It s really cool. And there s a lot of free food. Thanks, Tal!</td>

There s more to git than just the basic commit, push, and pull commands, Aaron began, and continued on a speedy but tho rough intro to git version control. Resident hackNY rocket scientist Randall Hunt followed up with a presentation on advanced Python techniques, explaining the intricacies of the Python and how it compares to other widely used languages.</td>

I am currently interested in authoring a Chinese grammar book with a focus on the functional usage of grammar structures, classroom teaching strategies, design of task-based activities, and assistance with students self-learning. I am also very passionate about teaching with technology and developing students Chinese proficiency in immersive intelligent learning environments. Yue said. The recent project that Jianling Yue has worked on with other professors at DLIFLC was the compilation of a Chinese Reading &amp; Writing textbook for over 600 students in a 63-week intensive course.</td>

We were a very close group, like a large family. I wanted that same feeling in college the closeness that comes with having a connection to the people around you but I also wanted the college adventure. People hear state school and often think of huge classes and that no professors will know their names. As a double major in broadcast journalism and political science, I, too, was expecting huge classes; to my surprise, I only had two auditorium-sized classes the entire year I was there. Most of my classes had about 35 people, and I really enjoyed my professors and classmates. It was a great school, and I had the college adventure I was searching for, but my heart ached for the family connection I was missing. The day I visited Ouachita, I knew it was the place for me. The campus was beautiful, and I immediately felt like I was home.</td>

I think as long as we are able to keep one eye on the current events, but another eye on history and on principles, then I think it s fine, he says. I think it s fine to absolutely mix it up with what s happening today. And I hope that connecting politics and history and journalism to the moment is useful and appealing to the students. For years, the class has been open to any student who studies in D.C. through UCDC, including students from all the University of California schools, the University of San Francisco, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania. Notre Dame students typically make up about half of the class, Lozada says. And though Notre Dame doesn t offer a journalism major, Lozada has still helped guide several students to careers in journalism. I had never seriously considered journalism, and then you see that, Caton says.</td>
